Low coupling between layers, high cohesion within them. 10/0
Separation of concerns. 11/0
Layers should be agnostic of consumers (a layer shouldn't know who's on top of it.) 4/4
Adaptability: be able to change. 2/0
User interface modules should contain no business logic. 10/0
Business logic layers contain no user interface and don't refer to user interface modules. 8/0
No circular references between layers. 8/0
There are at least three main layer types: presentation, domain, and data source. 3/9
Business layer only uses abstractions of technological services. 14/0
Separate development teams by layer. 1/22
Layers should be testable individual. 12/0
Prefer layers to interact only with adjacent layers. 4/4
A layer should be wary of exposing lower layers to upper layers. 1/0
Layers should hide lower layers from upper layers.
Layers should only interact with adjacent layers. 2/3
Changing a lower level layer interface should not change upper layer interfaces. 2/5
Distribute at layer boundaries 0/18
Layers are a logical artifact that does not imply distribution between layers. 11/0
Lower layers should not depend on upper layers. 6/0
Every layer should have a secret. 3/2
Layers should be shy about their internals. 8/0
Layers should be substitutable. 2/0
Layers can have multiple adjacent upper layers. 2/1
Always wrap domain logic with a service layer. 4/5
Rethrow exceptions at layer boundaries. 0/15
Layers should be independently maintainable and versioned. 2/0
Layers should have separate deployment units (eg separate jars or assemblies for each layer). 0/7
Layers may share infrastructural aspects (eg security) 7/0
The domain layer should not talk to external systems - the service layer should do that. 2/3
Inbound external interface modules (eg web service handlers) should not contain business logic. 10/0
